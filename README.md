# Containers


# Why do we need containers?
- Companies will spend a lot of money install applications on multiple machines.
- To save compute costs, and to prevent one application from affecting another application on the same machine, we use containers like Docker.
- They're isolated units that contain an application. 
- Machines can have multiple containers. There won't be any application conflict because the container isolates them.


# Applications on their own machines
- The applications will not affect each other since they are isolated by virtual machines

# Example of why companies use containers
- Imagine having 2-3 applications on one virtual machine 
- Sometimes, an installation or an update can affect each other and cause the other to crash
- To combat that, admins will use containers

# Containers diagram
- This is for visual learners like myself
- Containers like dockers would be used to isolate multiple applications installed on a single virtual machine
